SERMON<br />
<i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Gen. ii. 7.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the
ground</i>, <i>and breathed into his nostrils the breath of
life</i>, <i>and man became a living soul</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span>, my brethren, in noble and
grand words, noble in their strength and in their simplicity, we
are told of the creation of man, as separate and distinct from
that of all other creatures.&nbsp; Having formed his bodily frame
out of the dust of the earth, the Almighty breathed into him the
breath of life, and man became a living soul, in the image of the
living God.&nbsp; How far, and with what divine beauty, the
heavenly image was then reflected in its earthly type, the
splendour and perfection of God&rsquo;s handiwork, we know
not.&nbsp; However noble the glory of man&rsquo;s appearance,
however godlike its outer form, in that day, since then he has
fallen from his high estate, and sin and death, which marred the
purity of his soul, have left traces of their deadly leaven in
his framework of flesh and blood.&nbsp; And yet not utterly
debased or ruined it.&nbsp; For, still, the face of many a little
child bears stamped upon it the imperishable marks of God&rsquo;s
handiwork, and the beauty, and <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>freshness, and innocence shine out,
till we think of the faces of the Blessed before the Throne on
high.&nbsp; While all that is fair in the face of woman, and all
that is noble and true in that of man, tells only of the same
divine source.&nbsp; In a word, the whole living man, the body in
its strength, pride, and beauty; the mind, the keen reason, the
swift intelligence, the glowing imagination; and the soul, the
conscience, and the spirit answering within; lifting man out of
himself to the Heaven above him, and enabling him on earth to
hold commune as a spirit with the Father of all
spirits&mdash;each and all witness to the same truth&mdash;the
breath that is in him, his framework, his whole being are from
the breath of God, and therefore he is a living soul, immortal,
and for a life beyond this.</p>
<p>And nothing is commoner, even among worldly people, my
brethren, than a sort of easy, vague acknowledgment that it is
so; nothing easier than a kind of fluent talk about the soul, and
the importance, perhaps the necessity, of saving the soul; if not
just at present, certainly at the earliest possible opportunity;
if not by a life of faith and purity to God, and of truth and
goodwill to man&mdash;at all events by holding fast to some
particular set of opinions, or of texts, some one favourite
doctrine, or pet form of outward service to God.&nbsp; And even
below this range of talkers, there are others who say, The soul
immortal?&mdash;Oh, yes, of course, man is to be in Heaven
hereafter&mdash;if all be well&mdash;and we trust by the mercy of
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>God that at
last we shall reach that land; but, in the meanwhile, they live
on from day to day, in one round of easy smoothness, working only
for the body, its care, its comfort, its life; as if there were
no dwelling-place but earth; as if man&rsquo;s soul were but a
matter of concern for the future; as if Christ had never borne
the bitter Cross for man&rsquo;s sin, to open for him the gates
of Paradise!</p>
<p>Their terrible and fatal mistake, you see, is the fashioning
out a religion as a thing apart from their daily life, and
thinking of their souls as apart from themselves.&nbsp; Whereas
there is no true religion but such as speaks in a man&rsquo;s
life, and is its vital breath; and the soul is no other but the
man himself.&nbsp; They madly look upon religion as a thing for
Sundays, for fixed times only, and for set forms; times and forms
to be used as a sort of charm against uncomfortable thoughts of
death, or fear of God&rsquo;s anger; or as a set-off for the
follies, and sins, and selfishness of the week; something that
shall set all right at the last, and make the account square when
the balance is against them; or for still worse and weaker
reasons: because it is right and decent to go to church, and do
as so many others do whom they know and imitate, and whose regard
they value.&nbsp; God help the man&mdash;ere it be too
late&mdash;who trusts to such a scheme of religion as this; for
it is full of deceit and peril!&nbsp; It may end, and it probably
will end, in his forgetting his soul altogether.&nbsp; Not
forgetting to wish that his soul may be saved at last, <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and that peace
may be with him when death comes, and joy beyond it; not this,
because every man, however foolish or however wicked, wishes this
much, or will wish it some day; but absolutely forgetting and
ignoring the fact that the soul is the man himself; that its
life, and passions, and desires, and hunger, and thirst, are to
be looked to, cared for, and fed day by day; that if he hopes for
Heaven at all, he must begin to get ready for it <i>now</i>,
while life lasts; and that in neglecting this, and letting
religion slip out of his daily life, he is perilling his very
existence, he is dying by inches.&nbsp; Heart, conscience, soul,
spirit, are becoming seared, cold, dark, and dead, while he, to
all outward appearance in full strength, has the form of religion
but not its life; the words in his mouth, but no echo within; the
sound of the Gospel in his ears, but neither the spirit, nor
life, nor freedom of the truth, which spring from the abiding
sense of God&rsquo;s unseen abiding presence.</p>
<p>How shall any such being understand that religion, that
prayer, praise, and sacrifice are no mere matter between man and
man, but only between him and God?&nbsp; What does it affect him
to be told, or to agree, that man is a spirit, and that if he
seeks to worship the living God it must be in spirit and
truth?&nbsp; He scarcely knows what the desires, and passions,
and wants of the soul are.&nbsp; To him the words, life and death
of the soul, are little more than vague sounds.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that the two great springs of <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>his spiritual
life are to him but of light account.&nbsp; His Baptism, to him,
is merely a time when he got his Christian name; his confirmation
when he was old enough not to need the help of sponsors any
longer.&nbsp; But, as to his having then entered into a covenant
with God, by His divine grace, to live the life of a spirit, of
one made a living soul; and these vows being on him all through
life, it never even remotely occurs to him!</p>
<p>No wonder even that the solemn feast in memory of his
Saviour&rsquo;s death is a matter from which he may turn away
just as the whim, or the idle excuse of the moment prompts, or
neglect altogether through his whole life, without a thought of
peril.&nbsp; I say <i>altogether</i>, yet a day falls on him at
last, when, in the midst of decaying strength, a clouded mind,
and dying faculties, as the windows of the soul begin to grow
dark, he thinks it only right and decent that he should ask for
the Holy Communion, as all proper people (he says) do under such
circumstances&mdash;and he takes it; not because it has
strengthened and refreshed his soul all through life, but
because, without it, the fear of death is too strong for
him.&nbsp; He dares not go out of the world, in fact, and enter
on his Maker&rsquo;s presence without this one final token, as
<i>he</i> thinks, of not having utterly forgotten Him.</p>
<p>God forbid, brethren, that I should count little of even this
terribly late and weary confession of the God that made him; this
tardy, unwilling, owning that man is a living soul.&nbsp; But
mark well, <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>brethren, never forget, the wide difference between this
and the owning of God our Creator, and Christ our Saviour, and
the Holy Ghost our Sanctifier, here, now, in our daily work,
while life remains, while strength is ours, while the battle is
going on all round, and within us; while the devil tempts, and
the flesh has power, and the world is bright and gay.</p>
<p>See the difference between offering to God while we have
anything to offer, and when we have nothing; when all else has
failed us; when power, and pride, and human pleasures, and human
cares have all come to an end, and there is no further
possibility of indulging either the one or the other; but only
the intolerable weight of the past, only the deep conviction
remaining that our trial is over, our time of probation finished,
our Judge very near at hand; as the earth crumbles under our
feet, and Heaven is opening wide on our amazed distracted
eyes.&nbsp; Ah! or it may be Hell yawning beneath our troubled,
weary, bewildered feet.</p>
<p>Mark well the difference: it is the difference between living
Faith that can save, and dead Faith that is worthless.&nbsp; But
if man is a spirit, how shall his spirit&rsquo;s life be
maintained?&nbsp; Not by outward observances only; not by fixed
forms and rites only, on fixed days; though all these are noble,
and good, and blessed in their degree.&nbsp; The key to the truth
is written in words older even than the Divine words of the Holy
Gospel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,
and to <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>hearken than the fat of rams.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They
that worship God must worship Him in spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How?&nbsp; By striving after those blessed things wherein Christ
was our example, and far above all human perfection.&nbsp; Not by
leaving all the other outer services undone (for all are
good&mdash;they flow and always must flow from true religion, as
its natural and happy fruit), but by adding to them purity,
self-denial, thought of others, generous, unselfish, and
untiring; by suffering long and being kind; by love unfeigned; by
thinking no evil; by hoping all things, enduring all things,
believing all things; by readiness to forgive; by slowness to
condemn; by bold, brave, manly, simple faith; by striving never
to forget that unseen living presence which shuts us in all
round, which we so often say is about our path and bed, and
spieth out all our ways.</p>
<p>This, brethren, is the spirit of the religion which we want in
our daily life, in our shops and in our business; in the market
and in the counting-house; in the streets and the family
circle&mdash;not to be obtruded and thrust into men&rsquo;s
faces, as much as to say, &ldquo;Thank God, I am not as other men
are,&rdquo;&mdash;but to be the life and joy of the heart, the
light of the household; to be the motive power, the ruling
principle; for the one reason that we are not mere dust, as other
creatures, not to go down into the grave and be forgotten for
ever, but to live&mdash;live when this world has perished, and
they who believe in it and swear <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>by its gods alone, are, with all
their follies, and errors, and sins, blotted out&mdash;until the
Judgment Day; to live <i>then</i>, when true life dawns, and man
draws nearer and nearer to the fulness of God&rsquo;s holiness,
joy, and peace; and finds in Him more than lips can utter or soul
imagine.</p>
<p>And how can man do less than strive for this if he be
God&rsquo;s son?&nbsp; If the breath of the Almighty be in
him?&nbsp; His life must be a spirit&rsquo;s life if he believes
this.&nbsp; He must know and feel that even here, in this world
of strife and sin, and folly and darkness, and worldly pride and
false ambition, and unutterable selfishness, even here, all round
him, is the world of spirits.&nbsp; That unseen and holy beings
are near at hand, ready to minister to him, even as the land of
spirits itself is but a step from this&mdash;divided from him but
by a narrow line; that though here now hemmed in by falsehood,
and doubt, and fear, and perplexity, yet in a moment he may be
beyond the veil&mdash;swiftly passing from darkness to eternal
day, where doubt is unknown and fear comes not&mdash;from death
to life itself.&nbsp; No man of rational sense, who gives himself
time to think, and to pause for a moment amidst the daily
passions, and toils, and cares that consume him, can doubt this;
nay, he feels and knows the greater presence still.&nbsp; He
knows that the Living God <i>is</i> about him, his very life and
breath; that without Him he cannot live for a single
moment&mdash;in Him he lives, and moves, and has
being&mdash;whose Divine presence he has felt <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>again and
again within him, deep down in the recesses of his inmost soul,
his heart, and spirit.&nbsp; Against this, if he be true to his
own convictions, he cannot, dare not, resist.</p>
<p>And yet, brethren, plain as all this seems, and deep and
constant the necessity for man&rsquo;s thus owning his spiritual
life, and that he is indeed a child of God, living only at the
word of a Father in Heaven&mdash;strong and abundant the
conviction of immortality hidden in every man&rsquo;s
heart&mdash;how vaguely, and loosely, and lightly, is such
knowledge often held!&nbsp; The great boast of the present age is
its claim to universal knowledge.&nbsp; There is no bar to its
depths, no limit to its extent.&nbsp; It takes in all subjects,
human and divine; tries them by one standard, weighs them in one
balance.&nbsp; The inscrutable nature of God, the simpler nature
of man.&nbsp; It analyses the atmosphere of the stars, and weighs
in a balance the density of bodies beyond the sun; the laws of
light and sound are laid bare, and allowed to be wisely based;
miracles are declared to be impossible, and cease to have
existence; nay, never have existed, seeing that they contradict
some few principles of life and matter, of which we have gained a
scanty knowledge; or at least seem to contradict them; and that
the First Cause (for we have not learned to do without
one&mdash;as yet) will not and cannot interfere with His own
laws, being in fact a God, or first principle, who is bound by
His own edicts, and imprisoned within the fetters of His own
rules!</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>And
how, my brethren, do such men deal with words like those of the
text?&nbsp; There is some little difficulty in evading or openly
denying them, for the one reason that in their eyes mind does
appear to be immortal, and intellect to outlive the body in which
it dwells.&nbsp; But, as to the soul, the conscience, the moral
sense, the spirit within a man, so supreme is the power of modern
science, so keen the insight into all things human and divine,
into the cloudy records of past ages, and the thousand phenomena
of present life; so absolute the sway of intellectual research,
so abundant and so trustworthy the array of facts, that man can
not only by searching find out God, but so map out the solemn
acts of the Almighty, from the first day of creation to the last,
as to leave no doubt that what we as Christians hold dear, our
birthright as spirits, and our inheritance in the heaven to come
as spirits, is a dream, a mistake.&nbsp; They are far more
curiously anxious to prove man&rsquo;s nearness to the beasts
that die than to accept his birth from the breath of the living
God, as meant and made to be immortal.&nbsp; So monstrous, so
incredible, does this seem, that it sounds like a jest; yet this,
brethren, is neither time nor place for jesting, least of all
with such things as eternal life and eternal death, the birth,
the destiny of the whole race of man.&nbsp; It is no jest,
brethren, but the grave and shameful teaching of a book now put
forth by one of the men of science of this very age; calmly put
forth as the inevitable and incomparable result of long, careful,
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and
exhaustive study.&nbsp; The habits, ways, instincts, passions,
and peculiarities of hundreds of animals have been minutely
examined, and out of them has risen the foul and debasing
assertion that man has sprung from a race of inferior and filthy
creatures; without spark of conscience or sense of shame, without
perception of evil or of good, without power of speech&mdash;and
speech is but the fruit of thought&mdash;without a breath of the
living God within them, or a trace of His handiwork in their
whole being.&nbsp; So far from men being sons of God, they are
the offspring in remote ages&mdash;ages too remote to be measured
by any but the skill of modern science, the offspring of
creatures without a soul&mdash;creatures dead to every sense of
feeling but hunger, lust, and blood; only able to make known
their wants or miseries by inarticulate cries of rage, pain, or
despair; creatures who, in their turn, sprang from others yet
lower down in the cycle of life, fouler, more ferocious, and yet
more loathsome than the grinning ape.&nbsp; And from things base
as these, we are told, sprang all the noble, great, good, and
wise men that have trod the earth.&nbsp; From such a stock as
this all the purest, grandest, songs of truth, of victory, of
joy, of melody, and beauty; all the noblest flights of eloquence,
all strains of living melody; all that sages, bards, and
philosophers have uttered in words that can never die; all the
loftiest ideals of art, in glowing colour or in snowy marble; all
the splendour, and glory, and beauty with which man has crowned
the earth; <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>nay, more than this, the sublime words of prophets, of
seers, and apostles, from him who in solemn grandeur tells of the
thunder of Sinai, down to the visions in lonely Patmos; of heaven
open, of the great white Throne, and the Eternal King; yea, the
bravest and purest in every age, the men, and women, and children
who have gone undaunted to death, with joy on their faces, and
peace unutterable in their hearts, rather than deny their Master
or their birthright;&mdash;all these alike have sprung from a
thing that has neither speech, nor conscience, nor sense but of
being full or empty, whose only weapon is ferocity, and to whom a
morsel of garbage is a supreme delight!&nbsp; And, if it be so,
if this incredible boast of science be true, our text is a
lie.&nbsp; And if the text be false, the whole book in which the
words are shrined is unworthy of belief; the whole framework of
the Book of Life falls to pieces, and the revelation of God to
man, as we Christians know it, is a delusion and a snare.</p>
<p>And on what ground are we asked to receive so monstrous and
degrading a scheme?&nbsp; Because, forsooth, after careful study
of hundreds of various creatures, in different ages and different
climes, among their countless peculiarities, habits, and ways, in
their so-called instincts a man finds, or fancies he finds, here
and there, some faint glimmering of a resemblance to what is
human.&nbsp; In the plumage of birds, in their love for gay
colours, which is tacitly assumed, in their little arts and
artifices, cunning, and ferocity; in the rough or <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>smooth skin
of some wild creature of the woods or plains, he searches for,
and finds, some faint type of what happens among the idle, or
silly, or careless among ourselves, who believe only in brute
force, or obey the laws of fashion however preposterous and
absurd; of women who paint what they think God Almighty has not
painted aright; who distort their dress, or their persons; or of
men and women who bedizen themselves; in every conceivable form
of fantastic and foolish caprice.&nbsp; For these, and possibly a
hundred other such paltry reasons, cleverly collected and
cunningly adapted to ensnare the unwary, we are to believe that
between man who is immortal and the beasts that die, there is no
line of distinction.&nbsp; This is the latest book of Genesis;
this the most improved account of the creation.&nbsp; But if so,
if there is a particle of truth in this newest science, then the
work of creation, the progress from baseness to purity, from
darkness to light, having once begun, must be now going on, in
all its thousand grades and varieties; with still new steps of
progress from the lower to the higher, from the foul Ascidian
reptile to Man in the image of God!</p>
<p>Where, then, in the wide universe of created things is any
such example to be found, half way between the unintelligible
gibberish of the ape and the divine faculty of speech?&nbsp;
Where is one, only one, such monstrosity&mdash;base, and cruel,
and filthy, without a soul, or a ray of moral sense, knowing only
the passions of lust and hunger&mdash;who is even <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>remotely
beginning to grow into human likeness or shape?&nbsp; Not all its
brutal deformity lost, and not yet the glory of manhood
assumed?&nbsp; No such being has ever been found, in the records
of ancient travellers or sages, or even in the journals and the
dainty discoveries of modern science.&nbsp; But still between the
highest and most intelligent of creatures of the wood and field,
and the lowest in human shape, there stretches an infinite
gulf.&nbsp; A gulf not to be crossed but by the shallow and
flippant philosopher who scorns all idea of a living personal
Creator, and admitting no bound to his own knowledge, and no bar
to his understanding, denies the existence of his own soul, and
treats all idea of spirit with idle contempt.&nbsp; <i>Yet</i>,
<i>my brethren</i>, <i>the gulf remains</i>.&nbsp; God has drawn
the line between man and beast, and no human power can abolish
it, no human sophistry explain it away.&nbsp; Men may deny it, or
turn it to ridicule under the pretence of scientific discovery;
just as they deny the existence of God Himself.&nbsp; Denying
Him, the King and Prince of all spirits, they may well deny their
own spiritual being.&nbsp; But, still, the grand unalterable
truth abides,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>God breathed into man&rsquo;s
nostrils the breath of life</i>, <i>and man became a living
soul</i>;&rdquo; and as long as the world stands this truth must
abide as the foundation of all truth, of all religion, of all
progress, step by step in purity, holiness, and faith on our way
to Heaven.&nbsp; This is the witness of all human hearts, of all
human life.&nbsp; This is the conviction rooted deep down in <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>man&rsquo;s
inmost being; which, though he tamper with it, or stifle, or deny
it all through life, yet on the bed of death will speak to him
with unanswerable voice, as he draws nearer and nearer to the
unseen presence, to that Divine and Eternal Spirit from whom his
being sprang at the first.</p>
<p>With this conviction and this confession, my brethren, let us
be content.&nbsp; It has outlived centuries of scorn, the wit of
philosophy, the sophistries of science, the laughter of fools,
and the questioning of heresy.&nbsp; It will outlive all
centuries, all time.&nbsp; It will outlive them who deny, and
them who believe, it; to the one bringing confusion, darkness,
and shame; to the other, peace when the strife is done, the
beauty of holiness, the rapture of immortality.</p>
<p>If any be content to believe they are the mere chance
offspring from creatures of lust, ferocity, and shameless strife,
so let it be; they must even reap as they sow.&nbsp; Their next
creed is plain enough, and easy of practice; eat, then, drink,
and to-morrow die.&nbsp; But let us, as Christians, fly to the
greater, nobler doctrine than this, for the one reason that we
are the offspring of the living God, made in His image; and
having in us the breath of the Almighty, cannot die.&nbsp; Our
very framework of flesh and blood was that form and fashion of a
man in which Christ, the Blessed One, came to us on earth, in
which He lived and suffered; was tempted, scorned, mocked, and
nailed to the accursed tree.&nbsp; It is in His memory that we
keep this solemn <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>season; His whose blood was shed, whose body was broken,
when the heavens grew dark, and the earth trembled as He yielded
up the ghost.&nbsp; It was to glorify this human shape, and to
redeem the living soul within it, that He endured the bitter
cross.&nbsp; His death, His passion, His resurrection, are to us
what they are, because wrought in human form, to be crowned with
new splendour and glory in Heaven.</p>
<p>Again I say, let us be content with this hope which has been
the only stay of countless thousands in every age since Christ
trod the shores of Galilee, and spake to the listening thousands
by the sea.&nbsp; Let us be content with the plain living words
of Him who is Truth itself, who was before the world began, who
spake and there was light, who breathed into the lifeless dust
and it lived; Himself, the King and the Prince of all Life, the
Beginning and the End, the First and the Last; who will still
remain unchanged and unchangeable when this world of sin and
shame has become the kingdom of His Christ; when human philosophy
has died out, and human science failed; but the greater, and
purer, and nobler wisdom abides&mdash;greater, because God, the
author of it, is mightier than man; purer because it wins men
from the base things that perish, and nobler because Heaven is
higher than earth.&nbsp; Let us hold fast to this belief, firmly,
through life; that it fail us not on the bed of death, as we draw
near to the twilight of eternal day, and to the fulness of
knowledge which is Life.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Well is
it for us that neither the perverseness, nor pride, nor wisdom,
nor ignorance, nor intolerable vanity of man can snatch from us
the birthright of immortality.&nbsp; And they who basely attempt
to unsay what God has said, and to rob us of hope beyond the
grave, add but one more proof, not of man&rsquo;s having risen
from the foul beasts of the earth, but having fallen from his
first high estate.&nbsp; Their very ignorance, doubt, and
defiance of God are but tokens of their own corruption,
confusion, and decay.&nbsp; Meanwhile the earth abides in its
appointed course; heaven abides, life and death remain; truth is
immortal.&nbsp; Wise men, ripe for the grave, mighty in worldly
knowledge, babble of mysteries beyond their utmost ken.&nbsp; So
let it be.&nbsp; God is not unmindful of His own.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s little systems have their
day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They have their day and cease to be;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are but broken lights of Thee,<br />
And thou, O Lord, art more than they.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an
image of His own eternity; through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
